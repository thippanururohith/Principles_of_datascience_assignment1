•	Q1)
The three stages of the reproducible workflow are:Data Collection, Data processing, and Data analysis,. Here's an example of how these stages could be implemented for the given table:
1) Data Collection
The should be entered into a spreadsheet program and saved as a CSV fil
Once this file is created, it should be given a name and saved in a useful location. (raw_Fraility.csv)
At the same time that data are saved, a metadata file should also be created and saved with it.
•	Frailty codes indicate Person suffering with Frailty(Y), Person not suffering with Frailty (N). 
•	Height in inches ,Weight in Pounds
2) Data Preparation
In this stage, we'll focus on cleaning and preparing the raw data.
Work to be done:
•	Check for missing values
•	Check for outliers and errors
•	Add any necessary metadata or annotations
Folder structure:
•	Frailty_project/
•	data_raw/
•	raw_Frailty_data.csv
•	data_clean/
•	raw_Fraility_data_cleaned.csv
Data Analysis
In this stage, we'll perform exploratory data analysis and create visualizations to gain insights from the data.
Work to be done:
•	Generate descriptive statistics
•	Create visualizations to explore relationships between variables
•	Perform any necessary statistical analyses
Folder structure:
•	results/
•	descriptive_statistics.ipynb
•	data_visualization.ipynb
•	statistical_analysis.ipynb
•	figures/
•	histogram_height.png
•	scatterplot_height_weight.png
•	boxplot_frailty_grip_strength.png
•	Create a report summarizing the data and analysis
•	Create visualizations and graphics to support the report
•	Share the report and visuals with stakeholders
